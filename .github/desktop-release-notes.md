# EasyResearch Desktop

EasyResearch Desktop runs the same EasyResearch backend and Web interface as the npm CLI. It embeds the matching native EasyResearch executable, so Node and Bun are not required at runtime.

## 0.1.14 highlights

- Home workspace actions can rename the actual project folder or delete its
  conversation histories while keeping the folder and project files.
- Missing-folder recovery lets you choose the new location after an external
  move/rename and reconnect the existing root and child sessions. Open Work tabs
  follow the new location; active work requires confirmation before stopping.
- macOS ARM64 signature repair for [#7](https://github.com/hdu-ailab/EasyResearch/issues/7):
  native binaries are ad-hoc signed and strictly verified before acceptance;
  desktop packaging seals the application while preserving the accepted sidecar.
  Release checks verify and launch a copy installed from the DMG.

## Downloads

- Windows x64: download the `.exe` installer.
- macOS Apple silicon: download the `macos-arm64.dmg`, open it, and drag EasyResearch to Applications.
- Linux ARM64 (aarch64) with glibc: download `EasyResearch-<version>-linux-arm64.AppImage` or `EasyResearch-<version>-linux-arm64.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu), available starting with 0.1.12.
- Linux x64: use the npm CLI; its desktop build remains a development preview.

For Linux ARM64, replace the version below with the downloaded release:

```bash
version=0.1.14
chmod +x "EasyResearch-${version}-linux-arm64.AppImage"
"./EasyResearch-${version}-linux-arm64.AppImage"
```

Or install the Debian/Ubuntu package and open EasyResearch from the applications menu:

```bash
version=0.1.14
sudo apt install "./EasyResearch-${version}-linux-arm64.deb"
```

If the AppImage cannot start because the host restricts unprivileged user namespaces, use the `.deb` package or restore the host's namespace support. The app requires a working sandbox.

The npm CLI also supports Linux ARM64: `npm install -g easyresearch@latest` selects the native package automatically.

The Windows installer is unsigned. The macOS app has ad-hoc integrity signatures but is not Developer ID-signed or notarized. Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper may display a warning. On macOS, after verifying the checksum and attestation, remove quarantine with:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/EasyResearch.app
```

## Verification

`SHA256SUMS` contains the checksum of each installer. Verify the downloaded file before installation:

```powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\EasyResearch-*.exe
```

```bash
shasum -a 256 EasyResearch-*.dmg
```

```bash
sha256sum EasyResearch-*-linux-arm64.AppImage  # or the downloaded .deb
```

GitHub build-provenance attestations are also published. With the GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
gh attestation verify <downloaded-file> --repo hdu-ailab/EasyResearch
```

Updates are manual: choose **Exit** in the tray/menu bar, download the newer package from the latest GitHub Release, then replace the AppImage or install the new installer/`.deb`. Existing `~/.easyresearch/agent` state is preserved.
