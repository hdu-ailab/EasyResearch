# EasyResearch Desktop

EasyResearch Desktop runs the same EasyResearch backend and Web interface as the npm CLI. It embeds the matching native EasyResearch executable, so Node and Bun are not required at runtime.

## Downloads

- Windows x64: download the `.exe` installer.
- macOS Apple silicon: download the `macos-arm64.dmg`, open it, and drag EasyResearch to Applications.
- Linux: use the npm CLI; no Linux desktop package is provided.

The Windows and macOS packages are unsigned. Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper may display a warning. On macOS, after verifying the checksum and attestation, remove quarantine with:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/EasyResearch.app
```

## Verification

`SHA256SUMS` contains the checksum of each installer. Verify the downloaded file before installation:

```powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\EasyResearch-*.exe
```

```bash
shasum -a 256 EasyResearch-*.dmg
```

GitHub build-provenance attestations are also published. With the GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
gh attestation verify <downloaded-file> --repo hdu-ailab/EasyResearch
```

Updates are manual: download and install the newer package from the latest GitHub Release. Existing `~/.easyresearch/agent` state is preserved.
